## Course Project
<br>
<br>
## Lab 1 - Diode Characterization and Differential Temperature Sensor
This lab focused on measuring the saturation current of a 1N4148 diode and designing a temperature sensor using the diode’s voltage-temperature relationship, verified through simulation and practical implementation.

## Lab 2: - Low‐Dropout Voltage Regulator
This lab focused on designing and testing a low-dropout voltage regulator using a PNP transistor (BD136), an OPAMP (LM358), and a Zener diode, with performance verification in LTSpice and on a breadboard under varying load and input conditions.

## Lab 3 - Class-B Power Amplifier
Designed and implemented a single-supply push-pull Class-B amplifier, achieving 0.95W output, 40+dB distortion reduction, and 40%+ efficiency. Simulated with LTSpice for frequency response (150Hz-15kHz) and built the circuit on hardware.

## Lab 4 - Wide-Band Amplifier with Feedback
Designed and built a two-stage amplifier with voltage feedback to achieve a low output impedance and flat gain. Used BJT transistors to meet specifications for gain, bandwidth (2KHz-2MHz), and harmonic distortion. Simulated with LTSpice and verified performance on hardware, achieving the target output voltage and current consumption within limits.
